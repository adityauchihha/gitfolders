Ok so I had a problem, I had way too many repos. It really was hard for me manage all of them.
Then I had an idea to treat every repos as a file, and store those file in a folder, giving structure to all of your repos.
So now I can easily create a folder called web apps and place all my web apps repos into that, create a seprate folder for the extensions and place all the extension 
into that folder. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but I like organizing my stuffs so I made this extension.
Anyways, thats all this extension does.
